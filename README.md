##  Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **whether a customer will file an insurance claim** based on demographic, vehicle-related, and behavioral attributes.

It includes:
✔ Full **EDA**
✔ **Data preprocessing** pipeline
✔ Multiple **ML models**
✔ **Evaluation metrics**
✔ **Feature importance** analysis
✔ Actionable **business insights**

##  Problem Statement

The goal is to build a **classification model** that predicts whether a customer will make an **insurance claim**.
This helps insurers with:

*  Accurate risk profiling
*  Better fraud detection
*  Premium pricing optimization
*  Customer targeting

* LightGBM
* CatBoost
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

###  Evaluation Metrics

| Metric    | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Accuracy  | Overall correctness                        |
| Precision | How precise the model is on positive class |
| Recall    | How well it captures actual claims         |
| F1-Score  | Balance between precision & recall         |
| ROC-AUC   | Overall classification performance         |
